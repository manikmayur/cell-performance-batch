"""Protos wrapper — MODEL_INPUT (JSON) in, one JSON line on stdout.

Contract (docs/WRAPPER_SPEC.md in protos-v2):
  1. Read JSON from the MODEL_INPUT environment variable.
  2. Write exactly one JSON line to stdout; the last line wins.
  3. Diagnostics go to stderr — surfaced to the user on failure.
  4. Exit 0 on success, nonzero on failure.
  5. Only /tmp is writable; /app/repo is read-only; no network.

The heavy lifting is in the installed package, not here — the build
pip-installs the repo, so ``import cell_performance_batch`` resolves.
The sys.path fallback covers the case where that install step was
skipped (e.g. running this file straight out of a clone).
